						Technically proficient software engineering professional with hands-on experience in developing software features, architecture and tools for traditional and cloud-based industries.
					</p>

					<p>	
						I am currently working as software engineer at Pixel Together, developing new features and tools for the Pixel Together platform as well as for World Academy of Sport. The pleasure derived from problem-solving and working on a product that truly impacts people's lives, is what drives me. I have a broad experience in the software industry which includes software development, automation testing and user-experience design. 
					</p>

					<p>	
						I believe my experience of working in smaller, highly productive teams as well as bigger teams, which were very diverse, in terms of size, location and culture, has enabled me to develop strong work ethics and has developed my sense of cultural awareness further. I believe I have the ability to think critically and take responsibility, which has enabled me to work well under pressure while still delivering high quality work.
					</p>

					<p>	
						My interests include following and learning the latest trends in the field of technology, playing/following cricket and badminton and graphic designing.
